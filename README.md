# Instacart Market Basket Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes Instacart's transactional data to uncover shopping patterns, customer behavior, and product trends. Using associative algorithms and data analysis techniques, we aim to provide insights that can help optimize product recommendations, customer retention strategies, and overall business decisions.  

## 🔍 Dataset  
The dataset consists 6 files with 30 Million+ of anonymized grocery orders from Instacart, containing details about:  
- Orders   
- Products
- Product details such as aisles and departments  
- User purchase patterns  
- Reordered products  

## 🚀 Key Objectives  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Identify customer purchasing habits and group similar shoppers.  
- **Product Recommendation**: Build models to predict products that users are likely to reorder.  
- **Association Rule Mining**: Uncover relationships between frequently bought items.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features to improve predictive accuracy.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)  
- **Data Processing**: Numpy, Pandas  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, PowerBI  
- **Machine Learning**: Apriori Algorithm, FP-Growth trees, Association Rules  

## 📊 Key Insights  
- **Top-Selling Products**: Certain items are consistently repurchased.  
- **Order Patterns**: Most orders occur on weekends, with peak times around noon.  
- **Reorder Probability**: Customers tend to reorder essential items within their first few purchases.
- And more in the notebook!

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Implementing deep learning models for better recommendations.  
- Deploying an API for real-time prediction of reorder likelihood.  
- Exploring time-series analysis for seasonal shopping trends.
